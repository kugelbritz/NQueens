# NQueens
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Letting the user define N <= some Nmax (this should not affect the algorithm or its implementation details), use a stack to keep track of previous queen positions and to check to validity of any tried queen placements.

Data Structures (stacks)
Recursion
